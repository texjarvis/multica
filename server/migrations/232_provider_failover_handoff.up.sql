-- provider_failover_handoff is the auditable ledger AND ownership record for the
-- bidirectional provider usage/rate-limit failover policy (td-836aa9). One row per failed
-- task the policy evaluated: shadow-mode records what it WOULD do; active-mode
-- rows additionally own the task chain (see the partial unique index in
-- migration 234) so a late primary completion can be discarded deterministically.
--
-- No foreign keys / cascades by repository rule: original_task_id,
-- chain_root_task_id, issue_id, chat_session_id, source_agent_id, target_agent_id
-- and fallback_task_id all reference other rows but are resolved and cleaned up
-- in application code. Deleting a task/issue does not cascade here; the ledger is
-- an append-mostly audit trail and stale references are tolerated by readers.
