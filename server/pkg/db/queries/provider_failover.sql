-- For active-mode owning rows (state HANDOFF_PENDING) the chain-owner partial
-- unique index (migration 234) additionally enforces at-most-one owner per
-- chain: a concurrent claim raises a unique_violation the caller maps to the
-- max-one-per-chain decline.

-- name: CreateFailoverTask :one
-- Clones a failed GPT primary into a fresh Claude attempt, re-targeted to the
-- resolved Claude agent + runtime. This is a CreateRetryTask analog with three
-- deliberate differences: it re-points agent_id/runtime_id to the target, forces
-- a fresh session (a cross-provider run can never resume the GPT transcript, so
-- session_id/work_dir are dropped), and records parent_task_id for the
-- retry/resume machinery. All attribution columns are inherited UNCHANGED from
-- the parent so the strict accountable==originator constraint holds and the
-- handoff is not a new attribution event. Autopilot linkage is intentionally
-- NOT carried: failover only ever runs for issue/chat tasks (the service filters
-- autopilot out before calling this).
--
-- attempt = p.attempt + 1 inherits the parent's max_attempts. This never strands
-- the child: the claim/dispatch path (ClaimAgentTask) gates only on
-- status='queued' and per-(issue,agent) serialization — it does NOT compare
-- attempt to max_attempts, so a child born with attempt > max_attempts is fully
-- claimable. The only consequence is that if this Claude fallback itself fails
-- with a retryable reason, retryEligible (attempt < ceiling) declines a further
-- auto-retry — the intended terminal behavior for an exhausted chain.
