// Package providerfailover holds the explicit, auditable, fail-closed policy
// that hands a task off from one AI provider runtime to another when — and only
// when — the source run terminated on a usage/rate-limit condition. A separate
// internal liveness signal lets the service record shadow-only observations
// when an owning runtime stops proving liveness.
//
// This package is deliberately pure: no database, no network, no clock. It is
// the single source of truth for "should this failure become a cross-provider
// handoff, and in which direction?", so the decision can be unit-tested
// exhaustively and reproduced from a persisted ledger row. All side effects
// (persistence, dispatch, comments) live in server/internal/service and consume
// Decide's output.
//
// Direction (td-836aa9 hardening): failover began as single-directional
// (GPT/codex → Claude, a closed source whitelist). It is now a BIDIRECTIONAL,
// role/capacity policy: any provider in failoverProviders may be a source when
// its run hits a limit, and hands off to a DIFFERENT eligible provider that has
// capacity. So Claude → GPT works too, which matters when the Claude Max window
// ends and GPT is the one with headroom. Loop/ping-pong is prevented
// structurally by the at-most-one-per-chain guard and the already-a-fallback
// guard (see policy.go), not by direction.

// assume Claude.

// IsFailoverTrigger reports whether a failure reason is one a cross-provider

// Three reasons qualify:
//
//   - ReasonAgentProviderCapacityOrRateLimit — HTTP 429/529, "rate limit",
//     "overloaded", "no capacity available".
//   - ReasonAgentProviderQuotaLimit — HTTP 402, "usage limit", "quota",
//     "credits", "insufficient balance".
//   - ReasonProviderLivenessTimeout — an internal, shadow-only signal for a
//     started task whose owning runtime stopped proving liveness. It is derived
//     from the authoritative LivenessStore-gated stale-runtime transition, not
//     from a provider-specific task wall clock. The policy recognizes it so
//     operators can compare what a handoff might have done; the service forces
//     this path to shadow because terminal side-effect evidence is unavailable.
//
// Everything else is structurally excluded, and the exclusions matter:
//
//   - Auth (ReasonAgentProviderAuthOrAccess, 401/403): a re-auth problem, not a
//     capacity problem. Handing off would mask a misconfiguration and burn a
//     second provider's quota on a request that will keep failing.
//   - Plain timeout (ReasonAgentTimeout / ReasonTimeout): the model was actively
//     WORKING and hit a hard cap; re-running elsewhere risks duplicating what it
//     had started. Contrast ReasonProviderLivenessTimeout above, which is a
//     runtime-liveness observation and remains shadow-only.
//   - Network / server 5xx: transient and resume-safe on the SAME provider; the
//     platform's own retry path already covers these.
//   - Context overflow, process failure, config, model-not-found, unknown: none
//     is cured by swapping providers.
//
// Fail-closed: an unrecognized/empty reason returns false.
